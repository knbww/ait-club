# AIT Club: Research & Project IT/AI Hub 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **AIT Club**. We are a student-led research and engineering ecosystem built on the principles of top-tier university laboratories (MIT, Stanford, Harvard).

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic theory and high-impact technology through structured learning, deep research, and professional engineering.

## 🏛 Organization Structure

We maintain a rigorous repository architecture to ensure transparency, scalability, and professional documentation:

### 🛠 Core Ecosystem
* **[ait-hub-platform](https://github.com/ait-club/ait-hub-platform)**: The "Operating System" of our club.
* **[learning-paths](https://github.com/ait-club/learning-paths)**: Standardized 7-week cycles for AI, Algorithms, and Quantum tracks.
* **[research-papers](https://github.com/ait-club/research-papers)**: Scientific reports, literature reviews, and ISEF-ready publications.
* **[project-template](https://github.com/ait-club/project-template)**: Our standard blueprint for all new engineering initiatives.

### 🧪 Active Capstone Projects
* `capstone-quantum-sim`: Exploring quantum circuit optimization.
* `capstone-vision-aid`: Computer vision application for accessibility.
* *(Browse all repositories to see active developments)*

## 🧬 Engineering Culture & Standards

To maintain university-level quality, every member follows these protocols:

1.  **Branch Protection**: No direct pushes to `main`. All code is merged via Pull Requests with peer review from a **Lead**.
2.  **Conventional Commits**: We use structured commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `research:`) to track progress.
3.  **Documentation First**: Every project must include a `CITATION.cff`, `LICENSE`, and comprehensive `docs/` folder.
4.  **Academic Integrity**: Strict zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism. Every research piece is backed by a `references.bib`.
